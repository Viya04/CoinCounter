# Coin Detection and Counting using MATLAB

This MATLAB project detects and counts coins in an image using image processing techniques, including edge detection, morphological operations, and the Hough Transform.

## Features
- Converts the image to grayscale for processing.
- Applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
- Uses edge detection (Canny method) to identify coin boundaries.
- Performs morphological operations to refine detected edges.
- Uses Hough Transform for circle detection.
- Displays the detected coins along with their count.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (with Image Processing Toolbox)
- An image containing coins (`newimc.jpg` or any image you want to analyze)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Viya04/CoinCounter.git
